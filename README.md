# spectrometer-project-
In this project you are given a csv file that contains absorptivity data of an iron/ortho-phenanthroline complex in units of L/(mg*cm), and data containing the emission spectra of several candidate LED light sources for use in a spectrometer. The goal is to determine which LED is most useful for detecting the absorbance of the iron/ortho-phenanthroline complex.
